# AT-Final-Project
A system to track and analyze exercise form during workouts


### Progress
5/1/25 - Started creating files to build dataset.
    The script will download the specified videos from youtube, reduce the frame rate, play each frame and gain user input on good or bad squat form.


### Outline
- Make small dataset using youtube videos on good vs bad squat form
- The dataset will be composed of angle measures between major joints
- Train a neural network to recognize good vs bad squat form
- Get real time camera input and determine whether the squat form is good or bad
- show a visual cue on the display along with the pose-overlayed image to show how good the form is
